title: Customer Satisfaction for Banks
description: |
  In this project, we extracted bank customer feedback from Google Maps and trained a BERT classification model to detect positive reviews from negative reviews. Then we visualized all this data to draw insights.

# 1.Data Extraction
We began by scraping customer reviews from the bank's Google Maps page. This provided us with a substantial dataset of real customer feedback, including text reviews and associated metadata such as review dates and star ratings.

# 2.Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for analysis, we performed several preprocessing steps. This included cleaning the text to remove noise (such as special characters and unnecessary whitespace), tokenization, and converting the text into a format suitable for model training. We also balanced the dataset to ensure an equal representation of positive and negative reviews, which is crucial for training an unbiased model.

# 3.Model Training
We employed the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, a state-of-the-art NLP (Natural Language Processing) model developed by Google. BERT is well-known for its ability to understand the context of a word in a sentence, making it highly effective for text classification tasks. The model was fine-tuned on our dataset of bank reviews to classify the reviews as either positive or negative. We used a training-validation split to tune the model's hyperparameters and evaluate its performance.

# 4.Model Evaluation
We evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics helped us assess how well the model distinguished between positive and negative reviews. We also conducted error analysis to identify common misclassifications and improve the model further.

# 5.Data Visualization and Insights
After classifying the reviews, we visualized the data to draw meaningful insights. This included:

Sentiment Distribution: Visualizing the proportion of positive and negative reviews over time to identify trends and patterns.
Word Clouds: Creating word clouds for positive and negative reviews to highlight common themes and sentiments expressed by customers.
Geographic Analysis: Mapping the locations of reviews to understand regional variations in customer satisfaction.
Temporal Analysis: Analyzing how review sentiments have changed over time, which can help in assessing the impact of recent changes in bank policies or services.
# 6.Insights and Recommendations
Based on the visualizations and analysis, we drew several key insights. For example, certain branches or services might consistently receive negative feedback, indicating areas needing improvement. Positive reviews could highlight successful aspects of the bank's service that could be further leveraged or replicated across other branches.

# 7.Future Work
We identified opportunities for further enhancing the project, such as incorporating more sophisticated NLP techniques, expanding the dataset to include reviews from other platforms, or integrating customer feedback with operational data for deeper insights. This project showcases the power of NLP and machine learning in transforming unstructured customer feedback into actionable insights, ultimately helping the bank to improve its services and customer satisfaction.
