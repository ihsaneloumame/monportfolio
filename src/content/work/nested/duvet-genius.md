we suggest a use case within a factory setting where there are multiple motors running on the production floor. 
A production supervisor is looking to monitor these motors, likely for efficiency, maintenance, and operational purposes.

The scenario is focused on the supervisor's need to access a visual representation of the historical data of the motors, specifically tracking their speeds. 

This use case exemplifies the benefits of IoT and digital twins in industrial environments, where data-driven insights lead to improved operational efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced equipment lifespan.
